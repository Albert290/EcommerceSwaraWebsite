## Our Story

Urban Swaras Running Club began with just five enthusiastic runners who met every Saturday to run together and share breakfast. The group grew organically as friends invited friends, eventually moving from home gatherings to restaurant meetups. The name "Urban Swaras" was inspired by the grace and speed of antelopes, symbolizing "urban antelopes" for city runners.

## Member Testimonials

**Pascal**: "I joined Urban Swaras earlier this year, just hoping to spice up my running journey. Instead, I found a family that nudged me to be better. Members guided me into structured coaching, better running habits, and deeper discipline."

**Davis**: "When I joined the club, even 21km felt like a struggle. I never thought I could go beyond a half marathon — until a fellow Swara told me I was underrating myself. Seeing others push past limits, I had a wake-up call. Since then, I've run over twenty full marathons and a few ultras. This club has made running my lifestyle."
